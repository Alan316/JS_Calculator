# JS_Calculator
A Simple Javascript Calculator 

I wanted to sharpen my Javascript Skills since it's been a while and created this calculator as a means to do so. Once complete, I will make a list of necessary improvements that anyone can freely take a crack at.

- The calculator is now functional and does basic operations.
- All buttons except the EXP button are working correctly. I will explore fixing it at a later date.

To DO
- There needs to be a function which checks to make sure only numbers are entered.
- I need to make the calculator responsive. One suggestion would be to display the move the red column of buttons below the display bar on        smaller screens.
