# JS_Calculator
A Simple Javascript Calculator 

I wanted to sharpen my Javascript Skills since it's been a while and created this calculator as a means to do so. Once complete, I will make a list of necessary improvements that anyone can freely take a crack at. 

9/6/2017
- The calculator is now functional and does basic operations.

11/1/2017
- The Calculator is now responsive and will switch the position of the function button so that they line up under the input bar on screens less than 360px in width. 

To DO
- There needs to be a function which checks to make sure only numbers are entered.
- All buttons except the EXP button are working correctly. I will explore fixing it at a later date.
